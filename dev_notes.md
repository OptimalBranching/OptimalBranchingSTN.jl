# Notes for development

Target: Solving random sparse tensor network with boolean or real-valued tensors, based on the optimal branching algorithm.

Steps:
    1. In the very first step, consider the so-called regular branching, try to solve boolean-valued sparse tensor network.

Notes:
    1. For the MIS problem, in weakly connected random regular graph and ksg, the intermediate tensors are not very sparse. Only in high connectivity graph, the intermediate tensors are sparse. -> What's next?
